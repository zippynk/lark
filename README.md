# Lark
0.3.0
A programming language with mutable syntax.
______
0.3.0: The actually working update!

Everything here is out of date. Will be fixed soon.
## Use
Lark is used in the following manner:
`./lark [space seperated file names to execute]`
Files will be executed sequentially in the same enviroment.
More info on use will be added shortly.

## Status

Lark's name will be changing soon as it has been discovered there was already a programming language named Lark. Go figure. Lark is in very heavy development. As of now the very core of the language has been built. This is the part that does parsing and can deal with the mutable syntax. The current task it to deal with adding the basic language executer on top of which components can be added. As of now it seems that lark is somewhat usable, although not necessarily useful. Examples will be added.



## Todo
- Fix readme

## Vision
The end goal, the vision, of lark is to create a world where lark is the only accepted programming language and is mandatory teaching in all schools.

## Praise?

- _"It's one thing to make a language that I think is trash. It's another to implement it in a way that is harmful to the reader."_ - Aaron Weiss on an earlier, and much messier, version of Lark.

- _"We need to force-feed JacobEdelman some JSLint."_ - Anonymous on the horrible JS style in an earlier version of Lark.

-  _"As far as I'm concerned, self-mutate is synonymous with self-mutilate in terms of a programming language's capabilities."_ - Aaron Weiss on Lark's mutable syntax.

## History:

- Version 0.0.0: Pre-Usable, mostly a rough draft of core code.
